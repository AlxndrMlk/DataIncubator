# About the project

Most of us wake up every morning in the world full of sounds. 
We are so familiar with many of these sounds that we do not perceive them consciously anymore.
May it be noise of a nearby street or maybe birds singing - whatever you hear often enough disappears from your consciousness.

Nevertheless it does not mean that it stops influencing you.
